## What is Financial Literacy?

Financial literacy refers to the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. It involves knowledge of financial principles and concepts such as financial planning, interest rates, compounding, credit management, and the benefits of saving for the future.

### Importance of Financial Literacy

1. **Empowerment**: Financial literacy empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their money. It helps you understand the implications of financial choices and enables you to plan for the future.
   
2. **Economic Stability**: By managing your finances effectively, you can avoid debt, save for emergencies, and plan for retirement, contributing to personal and societal economic stability.
   
3. **Better Financial Decisions**: With a solid understanding of financial concepts, you can make better choices regarding investments, loans, and other financial products.

## Key Components of Financial Literacy

### Budgeting

Creating and maintaining a budget is a fundamental skill in financial management. A budget helps you track income and expenses, ensuring that you live within your means. By setting financial goals and monitoring your spending, you can identify areas where you can save money.

### Saving and Investing

Saving is the foundation of financial security. It involves setting aside money for future needs or emergencies. Investing, on the other hand, involves putting money into assets such as stocks, bonds, or real estate to generate returns over time. Understanding the risk and potential returns of different investment options is crucial for growing your wealth.
